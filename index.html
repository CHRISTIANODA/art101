		<h1>WELCOME</h1>

		<p>Here's a long winded paragraph about me. Where to begin? Well, a good starting point would
      be to address the quaility of this writing itself: I have severe insomnia! Yay! Which means I sleep around
      2-4 hours a night. Oh no. Yes, it's true, and that is not an exaggeration. So, pretty much, if anything in this paragraph
      doesn't make sense/the grammer/prose is atrocious, pleasue excuse me. Anyways, where to <i>actually</i> begin? </p>
    <p>As said before, in my other introductions for the class, I'm a 4th year art major. Yea, not too excited about that actually,
      I love art, don't get me wrong, but this school hasn't really been the best for learning the skills I need (but that's a rant for another
      day). Hobbies include, reading, videogames, and drawing.


</p> Here's the same super low quaility pic I used for slack.</p>
